## Getting Started

### Install pnpm

Make sure to have [pnpm 7.17.0](https://pnpm.io/installation) installed on your system.
The best way to have a clean pnpm installation is to use package manager like
[Homebrew](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-homebrew) or
[Scoop](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-scoop).

### Install dependencies

```shell
pnpm install
```

When you run this command for the first time,
pnpm will automatically install the correct version of NodeJS on your system.
